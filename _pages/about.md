I'm a second-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Kannan Ramchandran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/index.html) and [Thomas Courtade](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~courtade/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of computational economics, algorithms, statistics, and machine learning with a focus on theory and methods. I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Bilkent University in 2021.
