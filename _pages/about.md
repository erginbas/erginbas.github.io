I'm Yigit Efe Erginbas, a second-year [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Kannan Ramchandran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/index.html) and [Thomas Courtade](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~courtade/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of computational economics, algorithms, statistics, and machine learning with a focus on theory and methods. Before Berkeley, I obtained my B.Sc. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) from Bilkent University in 2021.
